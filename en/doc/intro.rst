About Story Master Toolkit NIMS (SMTK NIMS)
===========================================

SMTK NIMS - what is it?

	SMTK NIMS is an LARP handout editor. This is NIMS main feature and it must do it well. Also it solves more LARP specific tasks.

	SMTK NIMS is an interactive web page. You need only modern browser to work with SMTK NIMS. We check it in Firefox, Chrome and Internet Explorer. SMTK NIMS doesn't require internet connection. It can work in offline mode.

	
SMTK NIMS work sequence

	SMTK NIMS saves changes automatically in web page. For example when you make any text changes on  overview page then all changes will be saved in page (but not in file).
	
	SMTK NIMS can't save LARP game database to file automatically. You need to do it manually. NIMS always show "Do you save your database?" reminder on browser tab closing.

	LARP game database file is just a usual text file in JSON format. If you are interested you can open it in any text editor but be careful. If you brake something then NIMS will not load database next time.
	
	In general work sequence looks like:
	
	1. Open SMTK NIMS in browser
	2. Load your LARP game database for editing
	3. Make changes
	4. Save LARP game database to your computer
