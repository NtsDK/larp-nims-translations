Preparing handouts
------------------

Preparing handouts is a main SMTK NIMS task. Process is organized in next way. Each character participates in some events. Character has event subjective vision so we describe it. If we don't do that then character will see event information as is.

Character handout consists of parts:

	#. Character name
	#. Profile
	#. Inventory
	#. Events

.. note::

	Character activity is not printed in handout because it is a game master tool.

.. note::

	Enumerated data is standard output but you can freely select only necessary fields in in handout template. So you can remove any standard part.

.. note::	Example
		Character name + inventory is not a handout but an inventory list which game masters need to prepare.

Secondary tasks
---------------

1. Inventory lists. You can extract inventory list only by special template. So game masters may prepare all stuff by this list.

2. NPCs work. You can make a handout for NPC with some action plan. This plan describes what and where he need to do.

3. Self briefing work. We move self briefing to SMTK NIMS as usual story, split it by events and add connections with other characters.

4. Workload analysis. Social network and report tools are used for workload and connectivity analysis.
