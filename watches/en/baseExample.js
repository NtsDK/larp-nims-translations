In T.A. 490, Gondor's centuries-old peace was ended by the first of many Easterling invasions.[1] That war lasted into the following century, and from it Gondor conquered much territory in Rh√ªn north of Mordor.\n\nUnder the rule of the four \"Ship-Kings\", Gondor established a powerful navy and extended along the coast from the Mouths of Anduin. In 933,[1] Gondor captured the southern port city Umbar, formerly held by the hostile Black N√∫men√≥reans. Later, the Haradrim defeated Gondor on land and besieged Umbar; but King Hyarmendacil I strengthened his army and navy, and forced the kings of Harad to submit after a great victory in T.A. 1050.\n\nGondor reached its peak during the reign of Hyarmendacil, controlling a vast territory and holding suzerainty over neighbouring nations such as the Haradrim and the northern Men of the Vales of Anduin. Mordor was desolate and guarded by fortresses. Under Hyarmendacil I's successor, Atanatar the Glorious, The kingdom enjoyed such wealth and splendour that, according to The Lord of the Rings, \"men said precious stones are pebbles in Gondor for children to play with\".[4]",

While there, some dispute arose between them and the Dwarves over the treasure-hoard of Scatha the dragon.\n\nLater, in 2509, Cirion the Steward of Gondor sent summons to the √âoth√©od for aid in throwing off a combined invasion of Men from the north east of Middle-earth, and Orcs from Mordor.\n\nEorl the Young, king of the √âoth√©od, answered the summons, and arrived unexpected at a decisive battle at the Field of Celebrant, routing the orc army, and then destroying it as it fled.\n\nAs a reward, Eorl was given the plains of Calenardhon, and he moved his kingdom there. This land had earlier been part of Gondor proper, but had been devastated by the plague of 1636, and the survivors to a large extent slain in the invasion mentioned above.",
